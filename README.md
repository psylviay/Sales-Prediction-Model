# Sales-Prediction-Model
Gradient Booster model for predicting sales.

## **Objective**
Develop a predictive model to predict sales.

## **Scope**
A thorough understanding of an establishment's sales is critical to its success, as its impact reaches all areas of the organization (inventory, resource/employee allocation, marketing and advertising strategies, new product development, pricing and sales strategies, to name a few). And being able to predict sales raises decision making in all these areas to another level.

This project uses python to evaluate various machine learning models, select the optimal one for the dataset provided and predicts sales based on it.

## **Implementation**
Python will be the primary tool for the development and implementation of the best predictive model for sales. Models such as linear regression, random forest, neural network, etc. will be employed.

## **Outcome**
A robust predictive model that will enable the organization to make data-driven decisions, including but not limited to, operational efficiency, resource allocation, and marketing and advertising strategies.

## **Problem Statement**
In today's dynamic marketplace, being able to stay ahead of the competition is more important than ever. Brands need to anticipate sales in a methodic and consistent manner, and with consistent maintenance and optimization, to drive decision-making across their entire organizations.

## **Approach**
This project will use Python's machine learning capabilities along with predictive modeling techniques to create a robust predictive model for sales. The initial model training can be found within model_definition_training.ipynb. The code used for calculating the predicted sales on the real-life dataset can be found as Real_code.ipynb. The original training and test data file is sales.csv and the file with the predicted sales is called REAL_DATA_with_predictions.csv. Files for the processed data, scaler and model can also be found within this repository.
